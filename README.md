# Superhero database

## How to launch
- Clone ```master``` branch
- Install packages inside /server and /client folders (```npm i```)
- Launch server with ```npm start``` command

### Working on better (?) solutions in other branch ```after``` deadline
# Objective
We want to create a superhero database. For that, we want a web application that allows us to
do CRUD operations of the superhero model
The model
A Superhero consists of:
● nickname: Superman
● real_name: Clark Kent
● origin_description: he was born Kal-El on the planet Krypton, before being rocketed to
Earth as an infant by his scientist father Jor-El, moments before Krypton's destruction…
● superpowers: solar energy absorption and healing factor, solar flare and heat vision,
solar invulnerability, flight…
● catch_phrase: “Look, up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman!”
● Images: a set of images of the superhero
Superheroes
### Functional requirements
We want to be able to:
● Create, edit and remove a superhero
○ When creating / editing we want to be able to assign and remove images from
a superhero
● List all the superheros, seeing only one image for each and it’s nickname,
with pagination, showing 5 items at once
● See the details of one particular superhero with all it’s information and images
### Technical requirements
The webapp should be implemented having this technical requirements:
● Use Node.js (any version you feel comfortable with)
● Write down unit tests, at least for the main logic.
● A README with the steps to run the solution, and a list of all the assumptions that
you made (if any)
